        Hello! I am Aran Diez, graduated in digital photography and most
        recently as a Front-end developer.
      </p>
      <p className="section2__boxparagraph2">
        During my career experience I have worked as a photographer and creator
        of content, as well as design and digital retouching. My interest in the
        digital world and the development of the final product led me to become
        a Front-End Developer.
      </p>
      <p className="section2__boxparagraph2">
        My goal is to be part of a team of developers from which I can learn as
        much as possible. My skills include a good logical analysis and a great
        dedication. I am a persevering person but at the same time creative and
        empathic.
