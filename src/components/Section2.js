        Hello! I am Aran DÃ­ez, a graduate in digital photography, web designing
        and Front-end developer.
      </p>
      <p className="section2__boxparagraph2">
        During my career experience I have worked as a photographer and creator
        of content, as well as digital retoucher. My interest in the digital
        world and the development of the final product led me to become a web
        designer.
      </p>
      <p className="section2__boxparagraph2">
        My goal is to be part of a team of designers from which I can learn as
        much as possible. I am a creative and empathic person drawn by the
        harmony of compositions and the aesthetic. I also have a good logical
        thinking and a great dedication.
